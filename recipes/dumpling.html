    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Are you thinking of biting this momo? Hold a sec, I've a recipe for this.</p>
    <p>Let's follow some ingredients so that you should have a idea on what it takes to make a good pork momo at home.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>100 (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers</li>
        <li>1 Â¾ pounds ground pork</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>5 cups finely shredded Chinese cabbage</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, egg and cabbage. Stir until well mixed. </li>
        <li>Place 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling onto each wonton skin. Moisten edges with water and fold edges over to form a triangle shape. Roll edges slightly to seal in filling. Set dumplings aside on a lightly floured surface until ready to cook. </li>
        <li>Arrange dumplings in a covered bamboo or metal steamer so they don't touch to prevent them from sticking together; steam for 15 minutes, or until pork is cooked through. </li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
    </ul>
